👋 Hi, I'm Jose George

🎓 I am currently a graduate student in Applied AI & Machine Learning, passionate about building intelligent systems and real-world applications of data-driven technology.

💻 With a strong foundation in Linux system administration and hands-on experience in DevOps tools (automation, cloud, and CI/CD), I bring a unique blend of systems expertise and machine learning knowledge.

🚀 I am particularly interested in projects at the intersection of:

MLOps – streamlining the deployment and monitoring of ML models.

IoT (Internet of Things) – applying AI/ML to sensor-driven and connected device ecosystems.

🔍 Always curious and open to collaboration on innovative projects where AI meets scalable infrastructure.
